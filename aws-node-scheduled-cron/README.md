# AWS Node Scheduled Cron Example

This is an example of creating a function that runs as a cron job using the serverless `schedule` event. For more information on `schedule` event check out [our docs](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/events/schedule/).

Schedule events use the `rate` or `cron` syntax.

## Rate syntax

```pseudo
rate(value unit)
```

`value` - A positive number

`unit` - The unit of time. ( minute | minutes | hour | hours | day | days )

**Example** `rate(5 minutes)`

For more [information on the rate syntax see the AWS docs](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/ScheduledEvents.html#RateExpressions)

## Cron syntax

```pseudo
cron(Minutes Hours Day-of-month Month Day-of-week Year)
```

All fields are required and time zone is UTC only.

| Field         | Values         | Wildcards     |
| ------------- |:--------------:|:-------------:|
| Minutes       | 0-59           | , - * /       |
| Hours         | 0-23           | , - * /       |
